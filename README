This application consists of 3 main functionalities: Taking a picture and then editing it, uploading a picture and then editing it, 
and putting picture pieces together. When the user is editing it, the user should be able to click on any color and draw with that
color on the image. When the image is saved, it is automatically saved in the gallery. In the collage functionality, the user can put 
pieces of pictures together depending on how many pictures the user has. The user can then drag the image to place it in a desired 
position. 

All functionalities are fully working.
